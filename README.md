## Animal Companions for all Ranger (and Druid) Characters v1.6
### for ToB, BGT, TuTu, BG1EE, SoD, BG2EE, EET

This mod aims to give Rangers (and possibly Druids, should you choose so) some unique flavor by
allowing them to befriend a permanent animal companion.

**Overview**  
With this mod, all ranger/druid characters will gain the 'Find Animal Companion' ability at level 1.
(Note: Even though your character will gain the ability at level 1, you still need to get to level 3 in order to
actually have success in finding an animal companion.)  
Upon using your 'Find Animal Companion' ability, you will be able to pick an animal companion
from a list of available animals in your current area. (If there is no animal to your liking in a given
area, you can of course try it again in another area.)  
Once you've picked your new animal friend, it will follow you around on your adventures and even
increase in power as you do.  
  
**Animal Companions.**
**General:**  
In total, there are nine different animal companions to choose from.
While each of them has their own stats and unique abilities, all of them share a few common
characteristics.  
From a technical point of view, all animal companions are familiars (just like the familiars available
to mages, sorcerers and beastmasters). However, there are also some major differences between
those familiars and animal companions.  
**Power-Ups:**  
Animal companions don't gain experience like normal characters do and therefore do not gain levels
either. They do however gain certain stat boosts which are directly linked to their master's (the main
character's) experience.  
The downside of this is that each time the animal companion gains a power-up your main character
will lose a little bit of his/her experience. The lost experience symbolizes the animal companion's
'share' which it would get if it was a 'normal' none player character.  
This is also the only penalty your character has to take in return for an otherwise 'free' animal
companion.  
All animal companions will gain a stat boost once your character reaches these experience values:
Experience 50.000 450.000 1.350.000 2.250.000 3.150.000 4.050.000 4.950.000 7.650.000
Player Level* 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 33  
Exp. lost** 5.000 45.000 135.000 150.000 150.000 150.000 150.000 150.000
(*Please note: The stated player levels are only accurate for ranger characters, druid levels may differ.)  
(**Important! Please note: You will never have to take more than one experience penalty at once. E.g.: If you
start a new ToB game, your animal companion will get four power-ups in a row but your character would only
lose 150.000 experience (for the last power-up) in total.)  
**Death:**  
Just like most other creatures on Faerûn animal companions can die.  
However, not all is lost if your animal companion gets slain in combat. Like a none player
character a slain animal companion may get resurrected, even though it doesn't work exactly the
same as for other characters.  
To Resurrect your animal companion, an appropriate spell (Raise Dead, Resurrection, Mass Raise
Dead, Bhaalpower-Resurrection) or item (Scroll of Raise Dead, Rod of Resurrection, ...) needs to be
used on the dead animal companion's corpse.  
(This means, you can not have your animal companion resurrected at a temple or resurrect it
yourself in another area than the one it died in.)  
**Animal Companion AI:**  
All animal companions come with a very basic A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) which you can turn on
and off via dialogue options.  
You can choose between three options:  
(Note: Obviously, the in-game dialogue options look different than this, but shouldn't be too hard to figure out.)
1. Full A.I. (Combat and none combat behavior.)  
2. Only Combat A.I. (Animal won't do anything on it's own while out of combat.)  
3. No A.I. (Animal won't do anything on it's own.)  
In none combat situations all animal companions will try to stay within a certain range of the player
character. Stealth focused pets (panther, groundhog, rabbit) will also try to hide themselves.
In combat situations combat based animals (all but groundhog and rabbit) will attack the nearest
enemy as long as the player's health stays above 30%.  
If the main character's health drops below 30% the animal companion will try to aid the player by
attacking the player's last attacker.  
None combat oriented animals (groundhog, rabbit) will simply try to run away from any enemy and
hide themselves.  
  
**Special Abilities:**

**Hamstring Biting (Dog):**  
Once activated the dog will try to bit its opponent's hamstring.
For the next two rounds, every successful melee hit will reduce the opponent's movement speed by
50% for two rounds. (No save allowed.)
**Defensive Howl (Wolf):**  
The wolf howls to rally up the defense and awareness of all party members.
Every party member within 10 yards will gain +2 AC for 5 rounds.  
**Alertness (Groundhog):**  
Once activated the groundhog will focus all of its attention on watching out for surprise attacks and
utter warning sounds whenever a party member is about to get attacked.
During the one round watch all party members are immune to backstabbing.
**Zigzag (Rabbit):**  
Once activated the rabbit will circle around a target in a very fast zigzag course. If the target fails a
save vs. breath weapons it will be confused for two rounds.
**Web (Spider):**  
On use the spider will try to trap a target in its web. If the target fails a -2 save vs. paralyze it will be
trapped in the spider's web, rendered completely helpless for one round. 
  
**Requirements:**  
- BG2 including ToB with the latest official patch ( SoA only install might work, but has not been
tested yet.) OR BG1EE, SoD, BG2EE, EET, IWD1EE
  
**Compatibility:**  
The 'Animal Companions' main component should be (as in: I really hope it is ) compatible with
pretty much all other WeiDU mods out there.
(If you run into any compatibility issues, please contact me via the Spellhold Studios.)
The optional component to allow animal companions to be resurrected by the Rod of Resurrection,
will override any changes other mods might previously have made to the Rod of Resurrection.  

**Installation:**  
I. Extract the 'AnimalCompanions_v1.6.7z' file into your main folder and make sure that both, the
'Setup-AnimalCompanions.exe' and the 'AnimalCompanions' folder, are indeed in your main folder.
II. Run (double click on) "Setup-AnimalCompanions.exe".  
III. Choose whether you want druid characters to get animal companions too, or not.
IV. Enter a name for your future animal companion. (Note: Case sensitivity!)
